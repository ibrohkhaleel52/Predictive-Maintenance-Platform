# Decentralized Predictive Maintenance Platform

A blockchain-based platform for industrial equipment maintenance optimization using predictive analytics and digital twin technology.

## Overview

The Decentralized Predictive Maintenance Platform is a comprehensive solution that leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize industrial equipment maintenance. By combining digital twin technology, real-time sensor data analysis, and predictive analytics, the platform enables proactive maintenance scheduling and automated spare parts management.

## Architecture

The platform consists of four main smart contracts:

### Equipment Contract
- Creates and manages digital twins of industrial equipment
- Stores equipment specifications, maintenance history, and operational parameters
- Links physical assets to their digital representations
- Enables real-time monitoring of equipment status

### Sensor Data Contract
- Collects and processes real-time sensor data from equipment
- Implements data validation and verification mechanisms
- Stores historical performance metrics
- Provides APIs for data analysis and visualization
- Ensures data integrity through blockchain verification

### Maintenance Schedule Contract
- Generates optimal maintenance schedules using predictive analytics
- Considers equipment condition, historical data, and manufacturer recommendations
- Triggers maintenance alerts and notifications
- Tracks maintenance completion and compliance
- Updates equipment maintenance history

### Spare Parts Contract
- Manages spare parts inventory levels
- Automates parts ordering based on predictive maintenance needs
- Tracks parts usage and replacement history
- Optimizes inventory costs and availability
- Interfaces with supplier systems for seamless ordering

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ethereum development environment (Hardhat/Truffle)
- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- Web3.js or ethers.js
- Solidity ^0.8.0

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/predictive-maintenance-platform.git
cd predictive-maintenance-platform
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

4. Deploy contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network>
```

## Usage

### Equipment Registration
```solidity
function registerEquipment(
    string memory serialNumber,
    string memory manufacturer,
    string memory model,
    bytes memory specifications
) external returns (uint256 equipmentId);
```

### Sensor Data Integration
```solidity
function submitSensorData(
    uint256 equipmentId,
    bytes memory sensorData,
    uint256 timestamp
) external returns (bool);
```

### Maintenance Scheduling
```solidity
function generateMaintenanceSchedule(
    uint256 equipmentId,
    uint256 timeframe
) external view returns (MaintenanceSchedule[] memory);
```

### Spare Parts Management
```solidity
function checkPartAvailability(
    uint256 partId,
    uint256 quantity
) external view returns (bool available, uint256 leadTime);
```

## Security Considerations

- All smart contracts have been audited by [Audit Firm Name]
- Implements role-based access control (RBAC)
- Uses OpenZeppelin security contracts
- Regular security updates and patches
- Encrypted sensor data transmission

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

For coverage report:
```bash
npx hardhat coverage
```
